# DF Architect

## Release 3.3.1 (2022-05-28)
- **FIX #124:** Fix issue where enabling the See Walls on other layers would also enable it for the lights and sounds.
- **Fix #129:** Corrected issue with multiple libWrapper registrations for the same function. This was preventing wall-chaining and the force grid snap patch from working together.
- **FIX:** Some errors were cropping up when using the Alt Wall Drop for auto snapping.
- **FIX:** Fractional radii for light templates will now be rounded to nearest 3 decimal places when displayed in the Active Template UI. This stops the UI from becoming obnoxiously wide.

## Release 3.3.0 (2022-05-22)
- **NEW #119:** Switching wall types via hotkey while creating a new wall will also change that new wall to the selected type.
- **NEW #120:** Added new hotkey for toggling Force Snap to Grid on the Walls layer.
- **NEW #120:** Added a patch that will prevent Force Snap to Grid when holding the Shift key. Holding Shift normally bypasses any snapping, but except when the Force Snap to Grid was turned on. This fixes that abnormal behaviour.
- **NEW #115:** New Wall Gap detection feature. Allows you to search for and close small gaps in your wall connections. This feature was requested by [itamarcu](https://github.com/itamarcu) and based on the design of his most excellent macro.
